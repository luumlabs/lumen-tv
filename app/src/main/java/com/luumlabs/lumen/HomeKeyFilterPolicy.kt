/**
 * Decide whether the home guard should request ALL remote-control key events.
 *
 * Android <= 11 normally needs Home interception to avoid a long background-activity
 * launch delay. Coocaa / Skyworth Android 11 firmware reported in issue #15 consumes
 * Home before AccessibilityService.onKeyEvent; asking for the entire key stream instead
 * risks losing a volume KEY_UP and causing runaway volume changes.
 *
 * Limit the exception to this manufacturer AND OS version until other devices have
 * been tested. Window-state-based home detection remains enabled.
