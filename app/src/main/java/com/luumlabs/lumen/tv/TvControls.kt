 * whatever a brand doesn't override falls back to standard Android.

 * To support another brand: add `<Brand>Adapter.kt` to this package (see [CoocaaAdapter] for a
 * small one) and list it in [brands]. Every call except the two intents may block
 * (HTTP, settings, PackageManager), so call them off the main thread.
