## 2.0.4 bundled presentation assets

The project owner supplied `app/src/main/res/raw/default_intro.mp4` (Apple TV
startup animation, 1080p) and `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/default_settings_bg.png`
(Apple-branded settings artwork) for bundling. Apple names and logos remain
their owners' trademarks; these files are not covered by Tigris's source-code
license. Tigris is independent and not endorsed by Apple. User-uploaded videos
remain the responsibility of their uploader and retain their original rights.

The website's muted startup preview uses a compressed excerpt of this
owner-supplied clip for project documentation. It is not covered by Tigris's
source-code license and should not be republished without permission.

The website comparison animates an owner-supplied screenshot of a Chinese-market
TV launcher. It is not an interaction recording or a same-device before/after
test. Depicted brands and media retain their respective rights.

The aerial preview records the owner's television playing the Apple-hosted
screensaver. The app streams aerials and does not bundle the films.
